    A lot of the time for this task was spent on waiting for all the 
races to be done in the arena. 

    Getting to the Silver league was easy, but sadly that was as far as 
I got since my time is really limited currently.
I'm a bit rusty but I can get up to speed fairly quick.
I haven't used Rust in a year so I think taking the weekend to remind
myself felt good and I remembered why I liked it so much.

    The first leagues were easy to beat. Using just a few if statements.
The jump in difficulty in the Silver league really proved to be a 
struggle for me, because I just spent a lot of time just optimizing
the last versions, why didnt really provide any significant improvements.
After giving up with the improvements I started trying to find out as much
information as I could. Realizing all the checkpoints for a race have the 
same coordinates, I was thinking of using the A* algorithm to find the 
best way to the next checkpoint, but that was not very useful since I 
couldn't turn the pod myself. Then I figure I could make a Checkpoint
manager. Which would memorize all the checkpoints during the first lap.
And then it could use the boost during longest distance between 2 
checkpoints.

    It was over all a fun experience and I will try to get to Legend 
league when I have more time.
